!!!
1) different results for different BLOCK_NUMBER THREADS_PER_BLOCK, find inconsistency!
==> reduce operation does not work (sums up only 8 of 10 infections in the beginning) ??
!!!

2) SET IMPACT OF VACCINATION RATE (line 361)
2) change BLOCK_NUMBER THREADS_PER_BLOCK back to 256 256
5) make sure all gpu arrays are included in the destructor
6) are there any SNYC points necessary in the kernel? prior to step 3?
7) technically the transmitting part in step3 [line 105] should be a sequential section but 
    i believe the likelyhood of two threads running into a read write conflict is very small

X) benchmarking the whole thing plus the random initialization options

NOTES:
- using atomic, so only working for rtx
