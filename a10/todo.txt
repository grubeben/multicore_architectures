1) move 'sick people on Jan 1' (start of simulation method) to init
2) check whether it's allowed to pass struct element to kernels! (struct holds GPU mem elements as well as CPU mem elements)
3) name device vectors such as infected_on_dev more clearly to differentiate from scalar constants?
    f.e. infected_on_DEV?
4) integrate gpu_random (header files dont work easily in cu (at least that what 5min websearch says))
5) make sure all gpu arrays are included in the destructor
6) are there any SNYC points necessary in the kernel? prior to step 3?
7) technically the transmitting part in step3 [line 105] should be a sequential section but 
    i believe the likelyhood of two threads running into a read write conflict is very small

X) benchmarking the whole thing plus the random initialization options


NOTES:
- using atomic, so only working for rtx
